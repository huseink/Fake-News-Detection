Abstract

In today's world, the data on the internet is rapidly growing, especially through social media. This data is filled with information shared by users, intentionally or unintentionally, that needs to be questioned for its accuracy and reliability. Particularly, considering the fact that misinformation can distort people's beliefs when repeated, the importance of efforts to combat repetitive and dangerous news encountered on social platforms becomes evident. In this study, unsupervised machine learning is employed to perform credibility scoring on tweets from the Twitter dataset. A portion of the Turkish Twitter news dataset is manually labeled by collecting tweets from pre-determined users. Subsequently, the K-Means model is trained and compared with the manually labeled data. The results show that the model achieved an F1 score of 0.33, indicating its potential effectiveness in detecting false information on social media platforms and representing a significant step towards safeguarding users from misleading content.
